## Meeting Check-Ins and New Assignments

#### This took 4 hours.

During these weeks' team meetings, we reviewed project progress and addressed some final assignments. I was tasked with capping the number of miners allowed to mine a sand burrow at a time to five. I also took on the task of removing the summoning lightning skill, as it will not be part of the final game iteration. Additionally, I reviewed the bugs section in Notion, play-tested the game to find more bugs and final suggestions, and resolved questions about next semester's WolverineSoft application as well as the associate director position with Connor. Overall, these meetings went smoothly with no challenges faced since they primarily focused on final review and updates.

## Capping Miners per Sand Burrow

#### This took 8 hours.

To implement the cap of five miners per sand burrow, I first needed to understand the mining and harvesting system in the game. I consulted Eli for guidance, and he pointed me to the behavior tree and Entity scripts. Initially, I attempted to implement the cap in the task harvest scripts within the behavior tree, but this approach proved overly complex and ineffective.

I then decided to implement the cap directly in the Sand Resource Node script by introducing a sand worker counter. This counter could be accessed and updated through the DoNextTask() function in the Entity script. This method worked well, and the solution was merged into the main branch by Eli.

## Removing Summon Lightning Skill

#### This took 1 hours.

To remove the summon lightning skill, I identified all scripts that defined, assigned, and utilized the skill type, making the necessary edits. Additionally, I removed its three associated assets: the scriptable object, the lightning prefab, and the lightning audio file.

I then submitted a merge request for review. Before merging the new code into the main branch, Eli made a minor change to revert the skill enum values to their original state (I had reassigned values after removing summon lightning, which caused issues with other skills). There were no challenges faced for this task.

## Filling Out WolverineSoft Application

#### This took 2 hours.

I completed the application to return to WolverineSoft Studio for Winter 2025. The process took a bit longer than I initially thought due to having to answer new short-answer questions, decide between production and R&D roles based on my winter schedule, and update my portfolio. There were no challenges faced for this task.

## Play-Testing and Suggestions

#### This took 3 hours.

I play-tested the game to identify additional bugs or improvement opportunities before the showcase tomorrow, December 8th. I noted the following issues:

- Hover icons for builders and sand soldiers are larger than necessary.
- The pause screen overlaps with the player HUD.
- The ants and ant hills in the west corner of the screen during the tutorial are not easily visible due to camera panning limits and the objectives panel blocking that area.

These observations were added to the suggestions section in Notion, as they are not super critical to gameplay functionality. There were no challenges faced for this task.
