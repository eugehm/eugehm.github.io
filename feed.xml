I was tasked with capping the number of miners allowed to mine a sand burrow at a time to five. I also took on the task of removing the summoning lightning skill, as it will not be part of the final game iteration. Additionally, I reviewed the bugs section in Notion, play-tested the game to find more bugs and final suggestions, and resolved questions about next semester’s WolverineSoft application as well as the associate director position with Connor. Overall, these meetings went smoothly with no challenges faced since they primarily focused on final review and updates.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="capping-miners-per-sand-burrow">Capping Miners per Sand Burrow</h2> <h4 id="this-took-8-hours">This took 8 hours.</h4> <p>To implement the cap of five miners per sand burrow, I first needed to understand the mining and harvesting system in the game. I consulted Eli for guidance, and he pointed me to the behavior tree and Entity scripts. Initially, I attempted to implement the cap in the task harvest scripts within the behavior tree, but this approach proved overly complex and ineffective.</p> <p>I then decided to implement the cap directly in the Sand Resource Node script by introducing a sand worker counter. This counter could be accessed and updated through the DoNextTask() function in the Entity script. This method worked well, and the solution was merged into the main branch by Eli.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/devblog-5-mining-cap.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" controls=""/> </figure> <div class="caption"> Cap of five miners per sand burrow working as expected in the game. </div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/devblog-5-cap-merge.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Merge of cap of five miners per sand burrow into the game's main branch by Eli. </div> </div> </div> <blockquote> <p><strong>Challenges faced:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Locating the relevant mining code took some time.</li> <li>Understanding the task management system was initially challenging.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Strategies for improvement:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Allocate additional time to familiarize myself with the relevant scripts and systems when tackling new tasks.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <hr/> <h2 id="removing-summon-lightning-skill">Removing Summon Lightning Skill</h2> <h4 id="this-took-1-hours">This took 1 hours.</h4> <p>To remove the summon lightning skill, I identified all scripts that defined, assigned, and utilized the skill type, making the necessary edits. Additionally, I removed its three associated assets: the scriptable object, the lightning prefab, and the lightning audio file.</p> <p>I then submitted a merge request for review. Before merging the new code into the main branch, Eli made a minor change to revert the skill enum values to their original state (I had reassigned values after removing summon lightning, which caused issues with other skills).

We resolved the remaining merging issues with the skill tree, ensuring the branch was correctly integrated into the main project. My new assignments included implementing enemy burrows that award skill points to players when destroyed, redesigning the skill tree layout with updated logic, and capping how many troopers can mine a burrow at once.

Initially, I coded the logic to detect enemy burrows using their building ID, specifically ID “anthill” since it’s the only enemy burrow type currently implemented.

I implemented the same code adjustments for equipment data as in the skill data, allowing the skill tree to manage equipment too when players purchase equipment-related upgrades. I was also assigned two new tasks: adding art for the Archer Tower and setting up Burrows to grant skill points (if not already implemented).

The first meeting was focused on onboarding programmers to Notion and ensuring we all understood Project Sandcastle RTS’s documentation and how to use GitHub Desktop for version control. It was primarily an informative session, and I didn’t encounter any issues in understanding the guidelines on how to go about adding and changing scripts for the project.</p> <p>In the second meeting, we were assigned our first major tasks for developing core game loop factors. I was tasked with implementing the skill tree alongside Shane Huntoon. Shane had already created a mockup of how the skill tree should look and work but needed help with the actual implementation in the game, as he did not have access to the main game file.

I chose an isopod for my enemy character, made its sprite using graphic design software Figma, and followed the Common Actions documentation on creating a new unit to start the task. While placing the enemy in the game was straightforward, adjusting collision boxes was a little more challenging. Since I haven’t worked much with 3D assets in Unity, it took a bit longer than expected to figure out which collision boxes to alter and how to properly align the collision boxes with the sprite. However, after some trial-and-error and reference-checking, I eventually got it working.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/devblog-1-isopod-in-figma.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Making of isopod enemy unit sprite in Figma. </div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/devblog-1-isopod-in-game.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Isopod enemy unit with adjusted stats and collision boxes in game file. </div> </div> </div> <blockquote> <p><strong>Challenges faced:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Editing 3D assets, specifically collision boxes, was new to me.

I began by deconstructing the skill tree mockup visuals Shane created and gradually put them into the PlayerHUD Prefab but quickly realized I had scaled everything incorrectly once I tested it in the Game Scene. This took some time to correct, as each asset needed rescaling. After fixing the graphics, I moved on to adding a hotkey to open the skill tree—settling on the “R” key since that is the one Shane used in the mockup. The integration with the game manager, input actions, and event calls for opening and closing the menu was trickier than expected. I didn’t want to accidentally break anything in the game by adding to the PlayerHUD directly and adjusting the input actions, so I decided to use the Pause Menu set-up as a base and made the Skill Tree its own Prefab with a script similar to the pause screen’s, eventually making the hotkey fully functional.</p> <p>Next in line is making the buttons in the skill tree functional. I’m still figuring out how the skill manager should interact with the buttons and units to activate and unlock skills. I might need some assistance from Shane to fully understand that part of the program. Likewise, the PlayerHUD is currently partially blocking the Skill Tree visuals, but Shane and I agreed to focus on fixing that once the skill tree is completed code-wise.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/devblog-1-scaling.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Figuring out scaling of menu assets in Figma. </div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/deblog-1-skill-tree-ui.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" controls=""/> </figure> <div class="caption"> Hotkey opening and closing skill tree screen.

I checked in with Connor and Shane regarding my progress on the skill tree, and we also discussed if there were any additional tasks I needed to handle. Connor assigned me a new task to set up a basic skill point system, which would be essential for purchasing new skills in the tree and potentially useful for other gameplay features in the future. I continued working on making the skill tree functional, and overall, there were no setbacks during the meetings.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/devblog-2-sp-ui-task.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> New SP UI task in the Project Sandcastle RTS Notion. </div> </div> </div> <hr/> <h2 id="developing-the-skill-tree-manager">Developing the Skill Tree Manager</h2> <h4 id="this-took-6-hours">This took 6 hours.</h4> <p>I added a SkillTreeManager singleton that tracks the unlocked status of all skills using a dictionary. This allows changes to the unlocked status through the UnlockSkill() function and checks whether a specific skill is unlocked using the Unlocked() function. However, I encountered an issue while using the LoadData() function from the DataHandler script to load skill data into the SkillTreeManager’s dictionary. To resolve this, I created a separate LoadSkills() function, which worked as intended.</p> <p>I tested unlocking and activating the testSkill with no cost when clicking the buy button, which was successful. The next step is to ensure that locked skills remain locked when the player can’t afford them or when prerequisite skills haven’t been purchased.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/devblog-2-skill-manager-1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Part 1 of the SkillManager script. </div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/devblog-2-skill-manager-2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Part 2 of the SkillManager script. </div> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/devblog-2-load-skills.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> The LoadSkills() function in DataHandler script. </div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/devblog-2-working-unlock.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" controls=""/> </figure> <div class="caption"> The unlocking of a skill working as expected. </div> </div> </div> <blockquote> <p><strong>Challenges faced:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Trouble using the LoadData() function from the DataHandler script to load skill data into the SkillTreeManager.

The current skill point value can be retrieved with GetPoints(), and it gets updated through the AddPoints() function.</p> <p>I introduced the following three events using the EventBus system to streamline interactions between the skill tree menu, manager, individual skill nodes (buttons), and the points system scripts:</p> <ul> <li><strong>OnPointsChange:</strong> Published when the number of skill points changes.</li> <li><strong>OnUnlockSkill:</strong> Published when a skill gets unlocked in the SkillTreeManager’s dictionary.</li> <li><strong>OnBuy:</strong> Published when a skill is purchased, tracking the purchased skill’s ID.</li> </ul> <p>I also developed a new SkillUnlockNode script and attached it to each skill button in the tree. It monitors each node’s skill ID, cost, prerequisite skills, unlock state (Locked, Available, Purchased), and interactability. The script has three key functions:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Purchase():</strong> Activated when an OnBuy event is triggered. This function checks if the node’s ID matches the purchased skill, whether the skill is available, and if the player has enough points. If conditions are met, it changes the unlock state to Purchased, deducts points via Spend(), and calls UnlockSkill().</li> <li><strong>MeetsPrereqs():</strong> Returns true if all prerequisite skills have been purchased, false otherwise.</li> <li><strong>OnSkillUnlocked():</strong> Activated when an OnUnlockSkill event is triggered. If the node’s state is Locked and MeetsPrereqs() is true, it updates the state to Available and enables button interaction.</li> </ul> <p>Additionally, I added three new functions to the SkillTreeManager:</p> <ul> <li><strong>HasEnough():</strong> Checks if the player has enough skill points for a skill.</li> <li><strong>Purchase():</strong> Publishes an OnBuy event to update the relevant node to a Purchased state and unlocks subsequent nodes if they are prerequisites.</li> <li><strong>Spend():</strong> Deducts the cost of the purchased skill from the player’s skill points.</li> </ul> <p>I updated the UI to reflect skill points in the skill tree menu. Initially, the UpdateSPUI() function couldn’t find the SkillPointSystem instance when trying to retrieve the number of points. The problem was that the Awake() call for the SkillTreeMenu script was prioritized over the SkillPointSystem’s Awake() call. This was resolved by moving the call from Awake() to Start() in the Skill Tree Menu script.</p> <p>Next steps include documenting the skill point system in the Notion, updating the skill node placeholders to match Shane’s new mock-up, and disabling the PlayerHUD when the skill tree UI is active to avoid overlapping.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/devblog-2-sp-system.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> The SkillPointSystem singleton script. </div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/devblog-2-skill-node-1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Part 1 of the SkillUnlockNode script. </div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/devblog-2-skill-node-2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Part 2 of the SkillUnlockNode script. </div> </div> </div> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/devblog-2-sp-ui.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> The Skill Point UI. </div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/devblog-2-fix.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> The switch of the UpdateSPUI() call from the Awake() function to the Start() function. </div> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <img src="/assets/img/devblog-2-mock-up.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" data-zoomable="" loading="lazy" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> <div class="caption"> Shane's updated mock-up.
